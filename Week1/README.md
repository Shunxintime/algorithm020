学习笔记
This is the first week to learn algorithms.
For array and list, this is not so hard for me. 
However, heap and stack and queue, those are not easy for me.
1. Learn how to deal with the Leetcode.
2. Learn how to search the things not clear for me.(like queue,deque)
3. Write codes on white paper and also on leetcode day by day.
I am just an entry-level guy. But Time will Tell.
